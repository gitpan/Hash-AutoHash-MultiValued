Hash-AutoHash-MultiValued

This is a subclass of Hash::AutoHash which wraps a tied hash whose
elements are multi-valued.  

This class was inspired by Tie::Hash::MultiValue but differs from the
original in several ways: (1) It allows access to hash elements using
method notation. (2) It provides a 'new' constructor. (3) It lets you
set initial values when constructing the object. (4) When assigning an
ARRAY to an element, it flattens the reference. (5) The
duplicate-removal function can be set after the fact. (6) It provides
a general way to filter values.
